"""
    measureaccuracy(learner, features, labels[, confusion])

Measure the accuracy of a learner given a set of features and labels.

If the problem is a classification problem, this method returns the percent
of instances which are classified correctly. If it is a regression problem,
it calculates the root mean squared error.

If a confusion matrix is included, and the problem is a classification problem,
the confusion matrix will be updated to show common misclassifications.
